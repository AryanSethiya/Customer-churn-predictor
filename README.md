# Customer-churn-predictor
Overview
The Customer Churn Prediction application helps businesses identify customers at risk of leaving (churning) by analyzing their behavior and interaction patterns. Built using Streamlit, this web-based tool provides a user-friendly interface for exploring customer data, predicting churn probability, and gaining insights to improve customer retention strategies.

Access the app: Customer Churn Predictor

Features
Interactive Interface: Upload customer data and get instant predictions.
Data Visualization: Visualize customer behavior through insightful graphs and charts.
Churn Probability: Predict the likelihood of churn for each customer.
Actionable Insights: Gain data-driven insights to make informed retention decisions.
Customizable Inputs: Adjust thresholds or customer parameters for tailored predictions.
Technology Stack
Frontend: Streamlit for the interactive web app.
Backend: Python with machine learning models for churn prediction.
Machine Learning:
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, joblib.
Model: Trained on a customer dataset with classification algorithms.
Deployment: Hosted on Streamlit Cloud.
How It Works
Upload Data: Upload a CSV file with customer data.
Data Processing: The app preprocesses the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
Model Prediction: The pre-trained machine learning model predicts the churn probability for each customer.
Visualization: Results are displayed as charts and tables for better understanding.
